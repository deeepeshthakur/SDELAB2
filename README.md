# SDELAB2

This is a reimplementation of SDELAB, a MATLAB package for generating sample paths of initial-value problems for SDEs numerically,
as described in 

`H. Gilsing and T. Shardlow. SDELab: a package for solving stochastic
differential equations in MATLAB. In: J. Comput. Appl. Math. 205.2 (2007),
pp. 1002â€“1018. issn: 0377-0427.
doi: 10.1016/j.cam.2006.05.037 .`

SDELAB2 is implemented in Julia and provides the functionality described in this paper, though there are changes in syntax.
The key differences are
- drift and diffusion are autonomous (non-automous functions needs to disguised as an autonomous SDE)
- you specify the drift function (y->`f`(y)), 
diffusion-matrix function ((y,dw)->`g`(y) dw),
and diffusion-vector function (dif_vec[i]=(y->`gi`(y)) (i.e., a vector of functions y->`gi`(y).

- automatic differentiation creates Jacobian fns for `f` (for nonlinear solve) 
and for the diffusion-vector function `gi`  (for Milstein methods)

- the main driver routine is  

`t,y,W=sde_strong_solution(fcn, tspan, y0, opt)`  

where the return values are a vector of times `t` and corresponding matrix of solutions `y` (with rows corresponding to times), and  the position `W` of the driving Brownian motion at the final time,

and the inputs are:

- fcn is a special data type for describing the SDE coefficient functions, created by  

`fcn=set_fcn(d,m,y->drift_f(y,p),(y,dw)->diff_g_mat(y,dw,sig),diff_g_vecs(sig), noise_type)`  

(here `p` and `sig` are parameters)

for `d`=phase-space dimension, `m`=number of Brownian motions,  

- `drift_f`, `diff_g_mat`, `diff_g_vecs` are the coefficient functions for the SDE,  

- `noise_type=1` (unstructured), `=2` (diagonal), `=3` (commutative) (see the above paper for the meaning of this).  

- `tspan`=well-ordered vector of times where the solution is required 

- `y0`=`d`-vector of initial data

- `opt=set_opt(dt,method)`, where `dt`=maximum time step, 

 * `method="SIE0"` or `"SIE1"` or `"SIE"` (Euler-Maruyama for explicit, implicit, or alpha-implicit),

 * `"SSEH0"` or `"SSEH1"` or `"SSEH"` (explicit Stratonovich Heun for explicit, implicit, or alpha-implicit), 

 * `"SIM0"` or `"SIM1"` or `"SIM"` (for Ito Milstein),

 * `"SSM0"` or `"SSM1"` or `"SSM"` (Stratonovich Milstein), or 

 * `"SIBDF"` (second-order BDF). 

See above-referenced paper for details. All use auto-computed derivatives.

opt can be further adjusted to set  

`opt["Alpha"]`=parameter `alpha` for alpha-implicit methods (default `alpha=0.5`; trapezium rule)    

`opt["nlsolve_param"].maxfeval` and `.ftol` and `.xtol`    to control nonlinear sovler (default 10,1e-6,1e-8)    

`opt["calc_final_W"]` gives final position W of driving Wiener process (useful for calculating exact soln of geometric BM)    

`opt["do_plotting"]=true` or `false`, for automatic plotting via PyPlot  

`opt["always_clear"]=true` or `false`, to clear current plot each time  

`opt["output_sel"]`= vector of indicies to plot (default to `[1,2]`)  

`opt["output_plot_type"]="path_plot"` or `"phase_plot"` (`"time_phase"` and `"phase3_plot"` not yet implemented).  

SDELab2 depends on the Julia packages `NLsolve` and `PyPlot`.  

The package is currently being refined. The four examples presented (geometric Brownian motion, Van der Pol, FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, and Hodkin-Huxley) illustrate its use.
